CS Portfolio Report
Ahmed Mohammed
4, July 2024



1 Introduction
This report is to showcase my experiences during the making of
my CS Portfolio. Reasons for certain designs, references and im-
provements will be elaborated.


2 Goal
The goal was to make a website that can showcase my current
abilities by making it from scratch and learn along the way. Im-
plementing these skills should demonstrate necessary skills for the
job like fast learning and flexibility.


3 Design
There was a lot of thought process going through the design. At
first, Black and white professional themed website was in mind
to be made. After thorough thinking, I wanted to make it more
personalised, a design that can speak many things about me. For
example, I wanted to give the impression that I do not fear try-
ing new things and experimenting but with a touch of mine. So,
instead of the classic blue black or white designs, I wanted to go
for a unique background colour and that’s when I chose a tetrad
colour between green and blue. It is one of my favourite colours,
a mix of calm and energetic vibe.


4 Content
For what valuable information I wanted to add, I did not have
enough experience to showcase a lot of work. That’s why I focused
on the things I do best! making top level PowerPoint slides as well
as making websites to learn how to implement new feature into
them. I can also talk 3 languages which makes me a versatile cadet
for an international environment.



5 Code implementations and features
features and commands I used that was crucial for making this cs portfolio:
• Nav to navigate through and a href to make that transition when click
about or contact. I also used the basic ul to make an unlisted order.
• Div and class was used to define and classify data into different cate-
gories to make it easier to edit in the css file.
• Onclick, Id(to make an html unique with the actions) and the condi-
tional for in Java and was used to make that cool transition between
the skills, experience and education tab.


6 Conclusion and Improvements
While the website was clean and minimal, It feels like it could have
been better with a display of my older works as well as new features
like for example, a way to navigate to my social platforms. I plan
to add these these features as well as gain new experiences in order
to add them in the future.
